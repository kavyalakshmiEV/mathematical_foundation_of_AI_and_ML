LINEAR ALGEBRA: 

Algebra is arithmetic that includes non- numerical entities like x 

Ex: 2x+5=25 

 

If it has an exponential term, it isn't algebra 

Ex: 2x^2 + 5 = 25 (or) 2x^0.5 +5 =25 

 

Solving for un-knowns within system of linear equations 

If bank robber start a head of sheriff 5 minutes and speed of robber is 2.5km/hr and sheriff is 3km/hr 

Ex: d=2.5t and d=3(t-5) 

2.5t =3t-15 

T=-15/-0.5 

T= 30 

Sheriff catches the robber in 30 minutes 

 

 

But if the speed of sheriff is also 2.5km/hr then there is no solution 

And if they travel at same speed and at same time there will be infinite solutions 

 

So in linear algebra either it has one solution, no solution  or infinite solution 

 


 

It is a regression model 

Trying to predict house price 


Each y represents each house 

Xi1 to xim are features of house 

 a, b, c are variables which are unknown
